Forecast for 2018 confirmed

Hamburg, May 8, 2018 – Beiersdorf has started the 2018 financial year with a boost in sales, increasing organic sales by 6.5 % in the
first three months. In nominal terms, sales rose to €1.807 billion, up 0.4 % on the prior-year figure of €1.801 billion.
“Beiersdorf made impressive progress on its profitable growth path in the first quarter of 2018. Both business segments, Consumer
and tesa, delivered very dynamic performance and sales growth well above the market. These significant growth rates once again
demonstrate Beiersdorf’s strong international position and high level of competitiveness. Our continued success results from
strengthening our brands, accelerating our innovations, and systematically expanding our business activities in emerging markets.
Despite the current political and economic uncertainty throughout some regions, we look optimistically to the coming months and
therefore confirm our forecast for 2018,” said Stefan F. Heidenreich, CEO of Beiersdorf AG.
